The expected output for the FizzBuzz problem is a sequence of numbers, but with multiples of 3 replaced by "Fizz", multiples of 5 replaced by "Buzz", and multiples of both 3 and 5 replaced by "FizzBuzz".

***

## The Rules

The logic follows these simple rules for a given range of numbers (typically 1 to 100):

* If a number is divisible by **3 and 5**, you output **"FizzBuzz"**.
* If a number is divisible by only **3**, you output **"Fizz"**.
* If a number is divisible by only **5**, you output **"Buzz"**.
* Otherwise, you output the **number** itself.

1
2
**Fizz**
